Thanks to the help of tutoring and professional developr friends I was able to piece together several resources and with my own knowledge create a quiz that has an operating timer that counts down in 1 second intervals, questions and answers that pop up, color coding to correct and wrong answers, a percentage based score that sotres locally and displays in a list once the quiz ends, and it all loops and restarts once finished. Ideally I would've liked to have added some kind of consequence function that subtracts time as well as the ability for users to input their name with thier score but I struggled and put so much time into I consider these things to be bonuses at this point. Glad it works! Definitely struggled with layering javascript elements and putting things in order or even at the global level. Need to work on my psuedo coding as well. Dev tools was a life saver when it came to checking console logs and the application window to make sure my score history array was push-ing the right results. My biggest take away was how much I learned to use javascript to change html and css elements and how to use arrays.
