# Description
'''
Runs through questions and responds to user clicks on answers and tallies score correctly but does not reset when user completes quiz. I struggled to put all the pieces together. I frankensteined this code from a few different resources and tried my best to understand it all and put it together but there's issues with some of the key functions like the runTimer and stopQuiz and renderScore. It was rewarding to figure out certain things like changing css and html elements in javascript. I really wanted to use more jQuery but kept failing to incorporate it somehow. Still struggling with some base concepts like layering variables and functions and syntax in javascript. I know I could've streamlined a lot but this ugly code is the best I could get it to operate as close to the description of the assignment as possible.
